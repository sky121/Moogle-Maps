        <h4>Summary of the Project</h4>
        <p>
            We will generate a start and end coordinate in the map. The starting point will be on ground level. 
            The ending point being some coordinate 1000 blocks, not including verticality, away from the starting point. 
            Steve will try to find the fastest achievable path within a time constraint that minimizes the time taken while he 
            is on his way to the destination. During the journey, Steve might need to build paths and vessels to travel across different terrain. 
            The agent will take in the coordinates of the end point, its current position, health, hunger, and the blocks it can see in order to 
            take the best movement action to reach the goal. Movement actions include going forward and backwards, sprinting forwards, rotating the 
            body left and right, pitching head up and down, jumping, breaking block, placing block, crafting basic objects, eating food, and interacting 
            with objects.

        <h4>AI/ML Algorithms</h4>
        <p> We plan on implementing reinforcement learning using a neural network.</p>
        
       
        
        <h4>Evaluation Plan </h4>
        <p>We will be evaluating the success of our project by using a metric of the time it takes to reach the destination or the distance of 
            the agent from the endpoint, if it fails to make it. The baseline for our agent is to move closer to the destination 
            coordinate under time limit without dying (falling, lava, drowning). We expect to see improvements from just random 
            actions to movements toward the destination coordinate while avoiding natural obstacles that will slow its rate of
             approach, maintaining hunger levels, and utilizing sprinting. In order to understand the growth of our agent, we 
             will be graphing the agents distance from the destination coordinate and the time it takes to reach the destination 
             as well. We will also monitor the agent's pathing by graphings its coordinates on a 2d plane to see how well the agent
              is doing and if it is improving from just taking random paths. Through this we can visualize the internals of our 
              algorithms to see how well our agent is learning. For the moonshot case, we would like it if the agent started building 
              pathways or utilizing boats to go over the difficult terrain rather than avoiding them entirely. Additionally, we would l
              ike to see our agent using sprinting and food to reduce the time it takes to reach the destination.
